Ravana's ambitious plea for immortality was denied, but he was granted invincibility against celestial beings, divine birds, serpents, spirits, demons, and giants. Additionally, he acquired the power to shapeshift. In contrast, Vibhishana's humble wish to adhere to the path of righteousness impressed Brahma. As a reward, he bestowed upon Vibhishana the knowledge of the Brahmastra and the Amritvani.Anticipating Kumbhakarna's potential for misuse of power, Brahma enlisted Saraswati's aid. Under her influence, Kumbhakarna inadvertently requested the ability to sleep for extended periods. Despite initial annoyance, Ravana recognized the strategic advantage of having such a formidable warrior, albeit one who would be incapacitated for significant durations. "
